# Bike Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a Bike Price Prediction Model aimed at predicting the prices of bikes based on several features using machine learning techniques. The dataset is processed using popular libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `seaborn` to ensure data integrity and visualization. The model incorporates feature scaling techniques such as StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to normalize data before training. Various statistical analyses, including Q-Q plots and hypothesis tests, are used to understand the distribution and relationships of the data. Machine learning algorithms are implemented using `scikit-learn` to train and test the model, achieving reliable predictions. This project can be expanded for real-world applications, such as bike dealership price recommendations or pricing analysis for e-commerce platforms.
